RemindMe Developer Guide
---
RemindMe is a reminder application that features a combination of a list and a calendar. RemindMe makes use of both 
Graphical User Interface(GUI) and Command Line Input(CLI). 

The target users for RemindMe are National University of Singapore(NUS) School of Computing (SOC) students. SOC students
can enjoy the benefits of CLI and GUI, which is not common in reminder applications in the current market. Users can use
RemindMe to store their modules, assignments, exams, contacts and general events. RemindMe aims to reorganise students' 
hectic lives and solve specific needs of SOC students.

The main audience for the RemindMe's developer guide are future developers who wanted to further understand RemindMe's 
inner workings. The developer guide explains the overall structure of RemindMe and the general workflow of RemindMe.
The developer guide also explains how specific implementations work, specifically add, find, delete, edit, and calendar.
The developer guide describes the team's motive for creating RemindMe, and the user stories used when creating RemindMe.

## **2. Design**

### 2.1 Architecture

![ArchitectureDiagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder.
 Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
 and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#26-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#22-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#23-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#24-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#25-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class, which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

![Sequence diagram of the logic Component](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 2.2 UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `panels` and `cards` packages contain respective list panels and cards for `Module`, `Person` and `GeneralEvent`. While
the `calendar` package contains `CalendarBox`, `UpcomingSchedules` and other relevant UI classes that help build the `CalendarWindow`. 

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow2.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 2.3 Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `RemindMeParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("clear m/")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `clear m/` Command](images/ClearFeatureSequenceDiagram.png)

### 2.4 Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the RemindMe data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` `ObservableList<Module>` or `ObservableList<GeneralEvent>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The details of `Module`, `Assignment`, `Exam`, `Person` and `GeneralEvent` are omitted for greater readability of the diagram.

</div>


### 2.5 Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the RemindMe data in json format and read it back.
* CalendarStorage is accessed by UI component which is no indicated in the diagram.

### 2.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.
<br><br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented. <br>
The features are:
* **[Add Feature](#31-add-feature)**
* **[Find Feature](#32-find-feature)**
* **[Delete Feature](#33-delete-feature)**
* **[Edit Feature](#34-edit-feature)**
* **[Calendar Feature](#35-calendar-feature)**

### 3.1 Add Feature

#### Implementation

The proposed add implementation is facilitated by `ModelManager`, which extends `Model`. `ModelManager` contains FilteredList of each entity:
* Persons
* Modules
* General Events 

The following activity diagram summarises the general workflow for the Add Command:

![EditFeatureActivityDiagram](images/AddFeatureActivityDiagram.png)
*[Add Feature Activity Diagram for `add m/CS2103T`]*
  
The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step. Input: `add m/CS2103T`

**Step 1:** Your input is parsed into `RemindMeParser` using the `parseCommand` method.
<br>
<br>

**Step 2:** Based on the command word of your input (i.e., `add`), an AddCommandParser will be used.
<br>
<br>

**Step 3:** In `AddCommandParser#parseCommand`, your input will be tokenized using `ArgumentTokenizer`. `ArgumentTokenizer` uses your input, then searches for the prefixes and returns the `ArgumentMultimap`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 4**: Using the `ArgumentMultimap` checks the prefixes in your input and returns the respective `AddCommandParser`.

    Module: `m/`: `AddModuleCommandPaser`
    Person: `n/`: `AddPersonCommandParser`
    General Event: `g/`: `AddGeneralEventParser`  
    if it is an unknown prefix, `parseCommand` will throw a ParseException and returns a `AddMessageUsage`. Since the input is `m/`, `AddModuleCommandPaser` will be returned.

**Step 5**: In `AddModuleCommandPaser`, `AddModuleCommandPaser#parse` is called. Again `ArgumentMultimap` is created using `ArgumentTokenizer` but only with `Module` prefix: `m/`. The class diagram shows the Parser class diagram when passing your input into the appropriate `AddModuleCommand`.
<br>
<br>

![AddCommandParserClassDiagram](images/AddCommandParserClassDiagram.png)

<br>
<br>

**Step 6:** The `parse` method does a few checks:

* If there isn't the `PREFIX`: `m/` present, or the preamble of the `PREFIX` is not empty, or your search input after the `PREFIX` is whitespaces, then `parse` method will throw `ParseException` and returns a `AddMessageUsage` for `Module`.
* Else your inputs is used to create a `title` which is then used to create a `module`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 7:** `AddModuleCommand` is executed:

* Using the `module` as an input, the `Model#hasModule` method checks if the given `module` is a duplicate or not. If it is, it will throw `CommandException` and return a `MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_MODULE`.
* Else, using the `module` as an input, the `Model#addModule` method is called, and adds the `module` to the `UniqueModuleList` in `RemindMe`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 8:** The `CommandResult` is logged in the `logger` and using `resultDisplay#setFeedacktoUser`, returning `resultDisplay`. Using `resultDisplay#setText` shows the `CommandResult` in the `GUI`.
<br>
<br>


### 3.2 Find Feature

This section shows how find feature is implemented in RemindMe. It will describe the logic flow of RemindMe step by step. 

#### Implementation

The proposed find implementation is facilitated by `ModelManager`, which extends `Model`. `ModelManager` contains FilteredList of each entity:
* Persons
* Modules
* General Events

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step. Input: `find m/CS2101`

**Step 1:** Your input is parsed into `RemindMeParser` using the `parseCommand` method.
<br>
<br>

**Step 2:** Based on the command word of your input (i.e., `find`), a FindCommandParser will be used.
<br>
<br>

**Step 3:** In `FindCommandParser#parseCommand`, your input will be tokenized using `ArgumentTokenizer`. 
`ArgumentTokenizer` uses your input, then searches for the prefixes and returns the `ArgumentMultimap`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 4:** Using the `ArgumentMultimap` checks the prefixes in your input and returns the respective `FindCommandParser`.

    Module: `m/`: `FindModuleCommandPaser`
    Person: `n/`: `FindPersonCommandParser`
    General Event: `g/`: `FindGeneralEventParser`  
    if it is an unknown prefix, `parseCommand` will throw a ParseException and returns a `FindMessageUsage`. 
    Since the input is `m/`, `FindModuleCommandPaser` will be returned.
<br>

**Step 5:** In `FindModuleCommandPaser`, `FindModuleCommandPaser#parse` is called. Again `ArgumentMultimap` is created 
using `ArgumentTokenizer` but only with `Module` prefix: `m/`. The class diagram shows the Parser class diagram when 
passing your input into the appropriate `FindModuleCommand`.  
<br>
<br>

**Step 6:** The `parse` method does a few checks:

* If there isn't the `PREFIX`: 
    * `m/` present, or 
    * the preamble of the `PREFIX` is not empty, or 
    * your search input after the `PREFIX` is whitespaces, 
  * then `parse` method will throw `ParseException` and returns a `FindMessageUsage` for `Module`.
* Else your inputs is split into individual keywords, and contained as a `List of keywords`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 7:** The keywords will be stored in `TitleContainsKeywordsPredicate` as a `predicate`, then stored in `FindModuleCommand`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 8:** `FindModuleCommand` is executed:
* Using the `predicate`, the `Model#updateFilteredModuleList` is called with `predicate` as input.
* Using the `FilteredList<Module>#setPredicate` returns the filtered list of modules with titles matching to any of the 
  `keywords` as a `CommandResult`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 9:** The `CommandResult` is logged in the `logger` and using `resultDisplay#setFeedacktoUser`, returning 
`resultDisplay`. Using `resultDisplay#setText` shows the `CommandResult` in the `GUI`.
<br>
<br>

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:
![FindSequenceDiagram](images/findcommand/FindSequenceDiagram.png)<br>
*[Find Sequence Diagram for `find m/CS2101`]*

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `find m/CS2101` command:<br>
![FindActivityDiagram](images/findcommand/FindActivityDiagram.png)<br>
*[Find Activity Diagram for `find m/CS2101`]*
<br>
<br>

### 3.3 Delete Feature

#### Implementation

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `delete m/CS2103 a/3` command:<br>
![DeleteFeatureActivityDiagram](images/DeleteFeatureActivityDiagram.png) 
*[Delete Activity Diagram for `delete m/CS2103 a/3`]* 
<br>
<br>

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete operation works: <br>
![DeleteFeatureSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteFeatureSequenceDiagram.png)  
*[Delete Sequence Diagram for `delete m/CS2103 a/3`]*
<br>
<br>

RemindMe is able to delete an existing `Assignment` in an existing `Module`

The diagram below shows the relationships between `DeleteAssignmentCommand` and `DeleteAssignmentCommandParser` under 
the `Logic` component and the relationship between `Module` and `Assignment` under the `Model` component.

<br>
<br>
The following example usage scenario describes how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

    Assuming RemindMe has a Module named CS2103. This Module contains a AssignmentList that stores
    a list of Assignmnets:
    
    [D] Assigment1 due on  01/01/2021 2359
    [X] Assignment2 due on 05/05/2022 2359
    [D] Assignment3 due on 25/03/1021 2359
    
**Step 1:** The user launches the RemindMe application, `LogicManager` and `RemindMeParser` will be initialized.
<br>
<br>

**Step 2:** The user executes `delete m/CS2103 a/3` to delete the assignment at `Index` 3 from the `AssignmentList` of
the `Module` CS2103. This invokes the method `LogicManager#execute(String)` which then invokes the 
`RemindMeParser#parseCommand(String)` method.
<br>
<br>

**Step 3:** RemindMeParser will parse the command word `delete` and will create a DeleteCommandParser. The 
DeleteCommandParser will tokenize the prefixes and will choose to create a deleteAssignmentCommandParser to parse
the `Title` CS2103 and `Index` 3.
<br>
<br>

**Step 4:** The `DeleteAssignmentCommandParser` will create a new `DeleteAssignmentCommand` with the `Title` CS203 and 
`Index` 3 and return it back to the LogicManager.
<br>
<br>

**Step 5:** The `DeleteAssignmentCommand` verifies whether the target `Module` exist in the `FilteredModuleList` 
and whether an assignment exists at `Index` 3. If either fails, `DeleteAssignmentCommand` will throw a CommandException.
If not, it will invoke the method `Module#deleteAssignment(Index)` which removes the assignment at `Index` 3 from the 
`AssignmentList`
<br>
<br>

**Step 6:** A `CommandResult` will be created with a successful message if the user inputs are valid
and returned to `LogicManager`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 7:** Lastly, `LogicManager` saves the updated RemindMe.

### 3.4 Edit Feature

#### Implementation
RemindMe is capable of editing an existing `assignment`. 


Below is a class diagram to show the relationship between `EditAssignmentCommand and EditAssignmentCommandParser` under 
the `Logic` component and the relationship between `Module` and `Assignment` under the `Model` component.
<br>
<br>

![EditFeatureClassDiagram](images/EditFeatureClassDiagram.png)
*[Edit Feature Class Diagram]* 
<br>
<br>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step.

     Assuming RemindMe already has a Module named CS2103 and an Assignment Tut1 with time 01/01/2021 2359 stored.

**Step 1:** The user launches the RemindMe application, `LogicManager` and `RemindMeParser` will be initialized.
<br>
<br>

**Step 2:** The user executes `edit m/CS2103 a/1 d/Tut2` to edit the description of the first assignment
in the CS2103 module. This invokes the method `LogicManager#execute(String)` which then invokes the
 `RemindedParser#parseCommand(String)` method.

<br>
<br>

**Step 3:** RemindMeParser will then create `EditCommandParser` (omitted in the sequence diagram)
which detects the edit conditions and calls `EditAssignmentCommandParser` 
to parse inputs according to the format specified.
<br>
<br>

**Step 4:** The `EditAssignmentCommandParser` will create a new `EditAssignmentCommand` 
with the given module `CS2103` , the given index `1`, the description `Tut2` and a null 
date and return it back to `LogicManager`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 5:** `LogicManager` calls the `EditAssignmentCommand#execute(Model)` method 
which then verifies whether the target module and assignment exists and whether
 the edited content is valid, e.g. same content.
<br>
<br>

**step 6:** The `Model` calls `RemindMe#editAssignment(Module, index, Description)` method which retrieves
the module to edit from the `UniqueModuleList` ,retrieves and update the assignment and place the
module back to the list. 
<br>
<br>

**Step 7:** A `CommandResult` will be created with a successful message if the user inputs are valid
and returned to `LogicManager`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 8:** Lastly, `LogicManager` saves the updated RemindMe.

    Note: An EditAssignmentCommand can either change the description or date of an assignment, not both.
    
<br>

The above process is shown in the following sequence diagram:

![EditFeatureSequenceDiagram](images/EditFeatureSequenceDiagram.png)
*[Edit Feature Sequence Diagram for `edit m/CS2103 a/1 d/Tut2`]* 
<br>

Below is the separate sequence diagram for editAssignment(m, 1 , Tut2):

*[Edit Feature Activity Diagram for `edit m/CS2103 a/1 d/Tut2`]* 


### 3.5 Calendar Feature

#### Implementation

![CalendarSequenceDiagram2](images/CalendarSequenceDiagram2.png)
*[Calendar Feature Sequence Diagram]* 

**Given below is an example of how the calendar UI is created.**

**Step1:** `CalendarWindow` will be created at the start of the program.
<br>
<br>

**Step2:** `CalendarWindow` will then call itself `CalendarWindow#loadCalendar` to load the details into the calendar.
<br>
<br>

**Step3:** In the `loadCalendar` method,  to ensure that the details inside calendar are the latest, 
the method will then call `CalendarStorage#refreshStorage` to update the storage for the calendar.
<br>
<br>

**Step4:** In the `refreshStorage` method, calendar storage will be cleared first by calling `CalendarStorage#clear`
and then the details about events are retrieved from RemindMe model by calling `RemindMe#getFilteredPersonList`
, `RemindMe#getFilteredModuleList` and `RemindMe#getFilteredEventList`.
<br>
<br>

**Step5:** With calendar storage updated, the `CalendarWindow` will then store events to each respective day `CalendarWindow#loadCalendar`
and then the calendar will be ready to be displayed as a GUI. 
<br>
<br>

![CalendarSequenceDiagram1](images/CalendarSequenceDiagram1.png)
*[Calendar Command Sequence Diagram]*

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the calendar mechanism behaves at each step.  Input: `calendar`.

**Step 1.** Your input is parsed into `RemindMeParser` using the `parseCommand` method.
<br>
<br>

**Step 2:** Based on the command word of your input (i.e., `calendar`), a `CalendarCommand` will be created.
<br>
<br>

**Step 3:** `CalendarCommand` is executed, and that will set boolean `showCalendar` to be true, the boolean is then 
pushed to `MainWindow` to call `MainWindow#handleCalendar` to show the `CalendarWindow`.
<br>
<br>

**Step 4:** `CalendarWindow` loaded by its fxml file and called `CalendarWindow#show` to show its shown 
as a pop-up window for you.

<br>
<br>

* [Documentation guide](Documentation.md)
* [Testing guide](Testing.md)
* [Logging guide](Logging.md)
* [Configuration guide](Configuration.md)
* [DevOps guide](DevOps.md)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **5. Effort**

RemindMe is an enhancement on Addressbook 3(AB3). While AB3 only stores and mutate persons, RemindMe deals with Modules, 
Contacts, General Events, Assignments, Birthday and Exams. Assignments and Exams are directly related to Modules, where Modules have
Assignments and Exams. 

As RemindMe deals with multiple entity types, the parsers for RemindMe needs to parse new and different entries and inputs. 
RemindMe also needs new ways to store and display the entries, ensuring that RemindMe still maintains a fresh and clear 
GUI, compared to AB3.

Birthday has a date while Assignment, Exam, and General Event contain a date time. RemindMe makes use of the date time 
to show a reminder when RemindMe starts up. Therefore, RemindMe has to be able to parse date and time into the respective 
entities and ensure they are of the right format. 

Moreover, RemindMe has a calendar which is able to differentiate all entries in RemindMe based on the dates and time.
Assignments in Modules has a checkbox to indicate whether an assignment is done or not. This adds a new logic into RemindMe, 
compared to AB3, and additional GUI. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage exams, assignments and events deadlines
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* tend to forget upcoming events/exams
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI and GUI apps

**Value proposition**: Manage deadlines and events in list and calendar view format to remind forgetful users.
