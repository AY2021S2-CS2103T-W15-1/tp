--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer. You can download Java `11` via [link.](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
   * Set-up tutorial:
        * [Windows user](https://java.tutorials24x7.com/blog/how-to-install-java-11-on-windows)
        * [Mac user](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-macos.html#GUID-2FE451B0-9572-4E38-A1A5-568B77B146DE)
        * [Linux user](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-linux-platforms.html#GUID-737A84E4-2EFF-4D38-8E60-3E29D1B884B8)
<br>
<br>

2. Download the latest `RemindMe.jar` from our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/releases).
Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your RemindMe.
Double click the file to start the app. 
<br>
<br>

3. Alternatively, you can use the command line to run RemindMe. 
   Open your command line by searching cmd in your desktop search bar. Next, navigate to the folder with RemindMe. 
Type in `java -jar RemindMe.jar` in the command box and press Enter to execute it.<br>
<br>
<br>
The following windows should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](./images/Ui2.png)<br>
   *[Start up image of RemindMe]*
<br>
<br>   

4. Press start to proceed to the main window as shown below.<br>
   ![UiMainWindow](images/UiMainWindow.png)<br>
   *[Main Window of RemindMe]*
<br>
<br>         

5. Type a command in the command box and press enter on the keyboard to execute it. <br> 
   For example typing `help` and pressing enter will open the help window.
<br>
<br>   

6. Some example commands you can try:
   * `add m/CS2103`: Adds a module named "CS2103".
     
   * `calendar`: Displays the calendar complete with your assignment deadlines, exam dates, friends' birthdays, and event dates.
     
   * `exit`: Exits the app.
<br>
<br>   
   
7. Refer to [Section 3: Features](#3-features) for specific usage details of each command.
<br>
<br>

8. Use `clear` to remove the sample inputs and start adding your own!

## 3. Features
Examples used in RemindMe are interconnected. Therefore, you can follow along and gain a deeper insight into how each
feature works!

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters you supply.<br>
  For example: In `add m/MODULE`, `MODULE` is a parameter you provide, such as `add m/CS2103`.
  
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  For example: In `add n/NAME b/BIRTHDAY [t/TAG]`, the `TAG` parameter is optional. 
  Therefore, both `add n/Alice b/23/03/2021 t/friends` and `add n/Alice b/23/03/2021` are valid.

* Items in curly braces mean you can only choose to apply one of the given parameters.<br>
  For example: In `edit INDEX {g/NEW DESCRIPTION on/NEW DATE}`, either `g/NEW DESCRIPTION` or `on/NEW DATE` is supplied.
  Therefore, both `edit 1 g/Project meeting` and `edit 1 on/24/05/2021 2100` are valid.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  For example: `[t/TAG...]` can be used more than once!<br>
  Therefore, `add n/Bob b/10/12/2000 t/friend t/colleague` is valid.

* `DATE-TIME` should follow format day/month/year hour minutes: `DD/MM/YYYY HHMM`.

**Tips:**<br>

* `Commnands` are case-insensitive.<br>
    For example: `ADD` and `add` are both valid.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Warning:**<br>

RemindMe will not accept multiple parameters if it only takes in one!<br><br>

Commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` and `exit`) ignore extraneous parameters, except `clear`.<br>
For example: If you input `help 123`, RemindMe will return the result of the `help` function.<br><br>

Parameters must follow the order given.<br>
For example: `add b/BIRTHDAY n/NAME` is not allowed.<br><br>

If you have the [calendar window](#39-viewing-calendar-calendar-c) open while adding/editing/deleting/clearing events, 
it will not be automatically reflected on the calendar window. You would need to click on the **refresh button** to refresh the calendar. 

</div>

![refreshButton](images/refreshbutton.png)
