   * Set-up tutorial:
        * [Windows user](https://java.tutorials24x7.com/blog/how-to-install-java-11-on-windows)
        * [Mac user](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-macos.html#GUID-2FE451B0-9572-4E38-A1A5-568B77B146DE)
        * [Linux user](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-linux-platforms.html#GUID-737A84E4-2EFF-4D38-8E60-3E29D1B884B8)

3. Alternatively, you can use the command line to run RemindMe. 
   Open your command line by searching cmd in your desktop search bar.

<br>
<br>
The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   *[Start up image of RemindMe]*
<br>
<br>   

4. Press start to proceed to the main window as shown below.<br>

5. Type a command in the command box and press enter on the keyboard to execute it. <br> 
   For example typing `help` and pressing enter will open the help window.
<br>
<br>   

6. Some example commands you can try:
   * **`add m/CS2103`**: Adds a module name CS2103.
     
   * **`calendar`**: Displays the calendar with the assignments' deadlines, exams' date and friends' birthdays.

## 3. Features
Examples used in RemindMe are interconnected. Therefore, you can follow along and gain a deeper insight into how each
feature works!

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters you supply.<br>
  For example: In `add m/MODULE`, `MODULE` is a parameter you provide, such as `add m/CS2103`.
  
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  For example: In `add n/NAME b/BIRTHDAY [t/TAG]`, the `TAG` parameter is optional. 
  Therefore, both `add n/Alice b/23/03/2021 t/friends` and `add n/Alice b/23/03/2021` are valid.
  
* If you specify a parameter, that RemindMe expects only once, multiple times, RemindMe will only use the last 
  parameter. <br>
  For example: In `add m/MOD1 m/MOD2`, RemindMe will create a module called `MOD2`.
  
**Tips:**<br>
* `DATE-TIME` should follow format day/month/year hour minutes: `DD/MM/YYYY HHMM`.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Warning:**<br>

* Commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` and `exit`) ignore extraneous parameters.<br>
For example: If you input `help 123`, RemindMe will return the result of the `help` function.

* Parameters must follow the order given.<br>
  For example: `add b/BIRTHDAY n/NAME` is not allowed.

* If you have the [calendar window](#39-viewing-calendar-calendar-c) 
when adding/editing/deleting/clearing events, it will not be automatically reflected on the calendar window.
You would need to press on the **refresh button** to refresh the calendar. 

</div>

### 3.2 Adding: `add`
This section explains how to add entries into your RemindMe. 
<br>
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Note:**<br>
* The adding of an assignment/exam requires the related module to be added first.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Warning:**<br>

* Duplicate entries are not allowed. Example:<br>
  * Person/Module with the same name.
  * Assignments with the same description and date-time in the same module.
  * Exams with the same date for the same module.
  * General events with the same name and date-time. 
</div>

You can add:
* [3.2.1 Adding a person](#321-adding-a-person)

Using the add feature, you can add your friends to RemindMe and let RemindMe remind you of their birthdays. 
You can also add optional tags for them to showcase your relationship with them!

**Tip:**
* `BIRTHDAY` follows format day/month/year: `DD/MM/YYYY`.

</div>

Command: `add n/NAME b/BIRTHDAY [t/TAG]`

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### 3.2.2 Adding a module

assignments and exams for each module. Now, you can distinguish the assignments and exams for each module, easily 
keeping track of your workload.

Command: `add m/MODULE`

Example:
* `add m/CS1101`
* `add m/CS1203`

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### 3.2.3 Adding an assignment

adding your task to RemindMe. The deadline follows the `DATE-TIME` format.

Example:
* `add m/CS2101 a/Essay 1 by/01/01/2021 2359`

### 3.4 Finding: `find`
As you use RemindMe, you will have more and more entries. It can get taxing to look for specific entries, scrolling 
through all of them. Luckily, RemindMe has a way to look for them, using the find function, where RemindMe will show you
those matching the keywords you provide!

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Note:**<br>
* Only whole words are matched.
* Entries matching at least one of the keywords will be returned.
